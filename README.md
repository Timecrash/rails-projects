# rails-projects
A master repo containing all my Rails projects that aren't the Rails Tutorial's sample_app.
Most of these are gonna be from The Odin Project again.

Projects include:
- micro-reddit (via TOP's Active Record Basics) (http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/building-with-active-record)
- re-former (via TOP's Forms) (http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/forms)
