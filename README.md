# rails-projects
A master repo containing all my Rails projects that aren't the Rails Tutorial's sample_app.
Most of these are gonna be from The Odin Project again.

Projects include:
- micro-reddit (via TOP's [Active Record Basics](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/building-with-active-record))
- re-former (via TOP's [Forms](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/forms))
- members-only (via TOP's [Authentication](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/authentication))
- private-events (via TOP's [Active Record Associations](http://www.theodinproject.com/ruby-on-rails/associations))
